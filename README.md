Code Exercise for Wellspring
============================

[View the application](http://slatron.github.io/wellspring-exercise/index.html)

This is the result of my code screening exercise.

### Notes

* User error messages can be triggered by paginating outside of bounds or attempting to unselect all train line filters

* Client side sorting only applies to currently viewed results. Click on Table Headers to sort

* Filtering options demonstrate responsiveness. There is only one breakpoint at 640px

* Menu and message animations are CSS3 transisions

### Browsers Tested (all on Mac)

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari
* Mobile Chrome (Android and iPhone devices)

### Next Steps

These are the next things I would to to improve the application:

* Add unit tests - likely jasmine

* Work with designer to improve page styles

* Refactor UI jQuery functions into MVC framework

* Resolve outstanding bugs (below)

#### Known Outstanding Bugs
